```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text with a gradient background.</p>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a div with a gradient background.  However, if the `gradient-to-r` class is not correctly implemented or if there are any issues with the browser's support for CSS gradients, it might not render as expected resulting in a blank or incorrectly colored box.
